## MAST
Mobilized Assistance Supporting Translation (MAST) is a methodology that enables the church to quickly learn, implement and own its translation process.  The eight step method allows native language speakers to participate in both written and oral translations bringing together churches and communities to quickly have access to God's word in their heart language.
